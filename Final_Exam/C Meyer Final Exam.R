# Clusters 3 and 4 are the largest segment of the customer base by far. C3 
# comprises nearly half the data by itself, and C4 represents another third.
# Our marketing efforts should begin with these groups.

# First, C3 is socioeconomically diverse but primarily purchases items in
# price category 2. They are somewhat but not overly brand loyal, tending to buy
# less than 40% of their products from a consistent brand. Half of their 
# purchases are made in Proposition Category 5.

# Second, C4 tends to be on the wealthier side relative to C3, with the largest
# proportion of "highest" socioeconomic class of the four clusters and the
# largest affluence index. This group also makes most of their purchases
# in price category 2. This group is generally more educated than C3, nearly
# all being rated at or above 4. Their households tend to have an additional
# adult relative to C3 but no difference with respect to children in the
# household. This may represent a difference of one-parent versus two-parent
# households. This group is also noticeably less brand loyal than C3 when 
# viewed as a proportion, but they have the highest consecutive brand purchases
# of any cluster. Their purchasing basis is more diverse than C3, again being
# predominantly within Proposition Category 5, but with more spread across their
# secondary categories (mostly 6, 7, and 8).

# Customers in Cluster 1 have a purchasing basis that mirror C3's; no special
# basis considerations are due here. Their purchase price category pattern
# follows C4's, so again, no special considerations are due. This group tends
# to skew old, nearly two-thirds being in age bracket 4, and they typically
# have larger households with fewer children. Their brand loyalty follows the
# trend seen in C3; although they are not steadfastly brand loyal, they exhibit
# longer consecutive brand purchases.

# Finally, C2 deviates from the others in several notable ways. First, this 
# group has the largest proportion of socioeconomic "low" shoppers, and 75% of
# their purchases are made in price category 3. This group exhibits the highest
# proportion of brand loyalty, with 87% of their purchases tending to be within
# the same brand. Additionally, their basis for purchases is very different
# from the other three clusters: two-thirds fall into Proposition Category 14.

# Based on the above, I would recommend the following:
# * Price Category: Most of our marketing efforts should focus on Category 2. 
# Materials addressed to customers in Cluster 2 should instead highlight our
# selection of items in Category 3.
# * Brand Loyalty: Regardless of which definition of Brand Loyalty you apply,
# most customers buy from different brands. No single brand dominates for
# C1, C3, and C4, but the most popular brand given is Brand 144. C2 buys
# predominantly from Brand 55.
# * Prices: Marketing toward C1, C3, C4 should emphasize items in category 3,
# whereas materials for C2 should emphasize Category 3.
# * Medium: Most customers in most groups have access to TV, but marketing
# toward C2 and C3 should consist of a higher proportion of mail ads due to
# their lower levels of ownership.
